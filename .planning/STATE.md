## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fork Cal.com: Leverage mature scheduling platform with calendar sync and booking flows
- Guest booking (no student accounts): Reduce friction, students just enter email
- Auto-confirm bookings: CTOs set availability = implicit approval
- No payments: University program, not commercial consultations

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (Pre-execution):**
- AGPLv3 license compliance: Verify whether RainCal deployment requires public source code or qualifies as internal university use
- Organizations feature licensing: Confirm Organizations feature works in self-hosted without Enterprise Edition license

**Research flags:**
- Email white-labeling completeness: Known issue where "Disable branding" doesn't remove all Cal.com references — document which templates need manual updates during Phase 1
