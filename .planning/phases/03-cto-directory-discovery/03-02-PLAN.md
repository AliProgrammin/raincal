# Plan 03-02: Enhance CTO Profile Pages

**Phase:** 3 - CTO Directory and Discovery
**Objective:** Ensure CTO profile pages display relevant information for students
**Requirements:** DIR-02 (CTO profiles with bio/expertise)

## Context

Each CTO needs a profile page showing:
- Profile photo
- Name and title
- Bio/background
- Areas of expertise
- Available event types (booking options)

Cal.com already has user profile pages at `/{username}`. We need to verify they display the needed information and enhance if necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Directory page created (Plan 03-01)
- CTOs have accounts with profiles

## Tasks

### Task 1: Verify Existing Profile Pages

1. Check existing profile page at `/{username}`
2. Document what information is displayed:
   - [ ] Profile photo
   - [ ] Name
   - [ ] Bio
   - [ ] Event types

### Task 2: Add Custom Fields (If Needed)

If expertise/title fields don't exist, add custom profile fields:

1. Check Prisma schema for User model
2. Add fields if needed:
   ```prisma
   model User {
     // ... existing fields
     title     String?  // "CTO at Company X"
     expertise String[] // ["Cloud", "AI/ML", "Startups"]
   }
   ```
3. Run migration: `yarn prisma migrate dev`

### Task 3: Update Profile Display

Modify profile page to show CTO-specific info:

Location: `/apps/web/app/(booking-page-wrapper)/[user]/page.tsx`

Ensure page displays:
- Profile photo (large)
- Full name
- Title (if available)
- Bio (expandable)
- Expertise tags
- Available event types with descriptions

### Task 4: Profile Edit Form

Ensure CTOs can edit their profile:

1. Verify Settings → Profile page has:
   - [ ] Photo upload
   - [ ] Name field
   - [ ] Bio textarea
   - [ ] Title field
   - [ ] Expertise tags

2. Add missing fields to edit form if needed

### Task 5: Test Profile Flow

1. Log in as CTO
2. Go to Settings → Profile
3. Add:
   - Profile photo
   - Bio: "10+ years building tech startups..."
   - Title: "CTO at Example Corp"
4. Save and view public profile
5. Verify all info displays correctly

## Verification

- [ ] CTO profiles show at `/{username}`
- [ ] Profile displays photo, name, bio
- [ ] Event types listed with descriptions
- [ ] CTOs can edit their profile info
- [ ] Links from directory cards work correctly

## Notes

- Cal.com profiles already exist - this plan verifies and enhances
- May not need any code changes if existing profiles are sufficient
- Focus on ensuring CTOs can add necessary bio/background info
