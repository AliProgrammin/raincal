# Plan 03-04: Test Directory and Discovery Flow

**Phase:** 3 - CTO Directory and Discovery
**Objective:** Verify complete student discovery and booking flow
**Requirements:** All DIR-* requirements

## Context

Test the complete flow:
1. Student visits directory
2. Student searches/filters CTOs
3. Student views CTO profile
4. Student books session

## Prerequisites

- Directory page implemented (Plan 03-01)
- CTO profiles working (Plan 03-02)
- Search/filter implemented (Plan 03-03)
- Phase 2 booking flow working

## Tasks

### Task 1: Test Student Discovery Flow

As a student (guest):

1. **Visit directory**:
   - Navigate to `/org/raincode/directory`
   - Verify page loads with CTO list

2. **Search for CTO**:
   - Enter CTO name in search
   - Verify results filter

3. **Filter by expertise**:
   - Click "AI & Machine Learning" filter
   - Verify only relevant CTOs shown

4. **View CTO profile**:
   - Click on CTO card
   - Verify profile page loads with bio
   - See available event types

5. **Book session**:
   - Select event type
   - Choose time slot
   - Enter guest details
   - Complete booking

### Task 2: Verify Requirements

**DIR-01: CTO Directory**
- [ ] Public directory page exists
- [ ] Shows all org CTOs
- [ ] Accessible without login

**DIR-02: CTO Profiles**
- [ ] Profile shows photo
- [ ] Profile shows name/title
- [ ] Profile shows bio
- [ ] Profile shows event types

**DIR-03: Search Functionality**
- [ ] Can search by name
- [ ] Can filter by expertise
- [ ] Results update in real-time

### Task 3: Test Edge Cases

1. **Empty directory**:
   - Org with no members
   - Show appropriate message

2. **CTO without events**:
   - CTO hasn't created event types
   - Show "No available sessions" on profile

3. **Search no results**:
   - Search term matches nothing
   - Show "No CTOs found" message

4. **Mobile responsiveness**:
   - Test on mobile viewport
   - Cards stack properly
   - Search/filter usable

### Task 4: Performance Check

1. Directory page load time < 2s
2. Search filtering is instant
3. Profile pages load quickly
4. No layout shift issues

### Task 5: Document Known Issues

Record any issues found:

| Issue | Severity | Workaround |
|-------|----------|------------|
|       |          |            |

## Verification

All Phase 3 success criteria met:

- [ ] Students can browse CTO directory
- [ ] Students can search/filter CTOs
- [ ] CTO profiles show relevant info
- [ ] Complete flow from directory to booking works
- [ ] Mobile-friendly experience

## Notes

- Directory URL format may need adjustment based on org setup
- Consider adding analytics to track discovery patterns
- May want "featured" or "recommended" CTOs section later
