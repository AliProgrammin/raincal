Check which features are available in open source version.

### Task 2: Create Admin Account

   UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'admin@yourdomain.com';
   ```

### Task 5: Configure Admin Dashboard

1. Verify admin can see:

### Task 6: Remove/Disable Payment Features

Payment features should be disabled for this university program:
