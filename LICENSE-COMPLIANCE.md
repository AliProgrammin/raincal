# AGPLv3 Compliance Strategy for RainCal

## License

RainCal is a fork of Cal.com, which is licensed under AGPLv3.

## Compliance Approach

**Deployment Model:** University accelerator tool for RainCode program
- RainCal is accessible to RainCode accelerator students, CTOs, and staff
- Students book CTO advisory sessions through the platform

**AGPLv3 Obligations:**
- Network use triggers source disclosure requirement
- Must provide source to users who interact with the software over network
- Compliance method: Public GitHub repository at github.com/AliProgrammin/raincal

**Source Code Availability:**
- Repository: https://github.com/AliProgrammin/raincal
- All modifications documented in git history
- AGPLv3 LICENSE file preserved from upstream Cal.com

**Enterprise Edition:**
- `/packages/features/ee/` folder is under commercial license (not AGPLv3)
- We do not modify EE code
- Core scheduling functionality is fully open source

## Action Items

- [x] Fork is public on GitHub
- [ ] Add "Source Code" link in RainCal footer pointing to GitHub repo
- [ ] Consult legal counsel to confirm compliance approach

## Review Schedule

Annually, or when deployment model changes significantly.
